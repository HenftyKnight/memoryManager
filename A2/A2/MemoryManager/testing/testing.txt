PURPOSE: Testing Strategy

1)For testing, firstly tried calls to myMalloc(),
Example: myMalloc(3)  --> returns 4
         myMalloc(6)  --> returns 16
         myMalloc(20) --> returns 32
         myMalloc(23) --> returns 60
         myMalloc(24) --> returns 92
which showed that, myMalloc returns pointer to where the user data begins in
each block

2)After that I called outputMemory()
  to check block status, start of the memory block, end of the memory block and 
  block size, which showed up like,

3) After that I used myFree to free memory
Example myFree(P3), 
--> I used a middle chunk so that I know if my 
    helper functions is_leftchunk_free() or is_rightchunk_free, tell me if the left or right chunks are free.
    which they are not, as of yet.
myFree(P2)
--> Free P2.
--> Which will have it's right chunk P3 free, so they will colease with each other to form a big chunk.

4) outputMemory()
--> To check the status of the free , coleased and allocaetd blocks.

5) Try some more calls to myMalloc(), which will show me, if the memory is assigned to the coleased memory
regions or not.
myMalloc(7)
myMalloc(12)

6) outputMemory() 
Calling outputMemory to check the status of the recent myMalloc calls. 

7) myMalloc(65532)
--> And at last trying to access more than accesible memory.
--> No memory Allocated

So, this was my approach to check for all the helper functions that I have made and that they are correctly working.
Thank you
